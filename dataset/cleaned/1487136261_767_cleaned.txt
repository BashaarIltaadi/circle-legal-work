STATEMENT OF OBJECT AND REASONS 
 
This Bill intends to replace the Companies Ordinance, 1984 (XLVII of 1984) in order to 
consolidate and amend the laws relating to companies so as to encourage and promote 
corporatization in Pakistan based on best international practices. Earlier, amendments in 
Companies Ordinance, 1984 were made in piecemeal and were narrowly focused, resulting in 
disconnect and overlap in regulatory framework and there is a dire need to review and revamp 
the thirty two years old legislation to provide competitive legal framework for the corporate 
sector in Pakistan.  
 
The Bill will ensure maximum participation of members in decision making process of 
the company through use of modern electronic means of communication and aims to address the 
issues relating to protection of interest of minority shareholders and creditors. It will facilitate the 
growth of economy in general and the corporate sector in particular by providing simplified 
procedure for ease of starting and doing business, greater protection of investors and augment 
corporatization in the country.  
 
The Bill provides adequate measures against fraud, money laundering and terrorist 
financing and necessary provisions have been proposed regarding powers of the Commission to 
investigate including joint investigation and provisions requiring officers of a company to take 
adequate measures to curb such violations.  
 
In order to give immediate impetus to the economy and to stimulate economic growth 
there is an emergent need to make law and provide relief and incentives to corporate sector 
especially small and medium size companies. The market experts and business community were 
in unison during various stakeholders‘ consultations on the company law that it should be 
enacted at the earliest as it will elevate Pakistan‘s economy and address long standing demands 
of the business community. Unless emergent legislative steps are taken, Pakistan‘s corporate 
sector will not be able to compete with the international market players without reduction in cost 
of incorporating and doing business. The encouragement of use of modern communication 
technology coupled with simplified regulatory procedure as envisaged in the Bill will provide 
much needed relief to the corporate sector. Moreover, Pakistan has recently been upgraded to 
emerging market status and there is a huge international interest to invest in Pakistan due to 
various policy initiatives of the government. The expeditious merger and acquisition mechanism 
are also necessary to address corporate solvency and growth in Pakistan.
