Preface 
 
SME sector contributes significantly towards national GDP, employment generation and export earnings. Hence, 
the impact of financial inclusion of SMEs has important implications for economic growth, competitiveness, and 
job creation. The potential for this sector to contribute to the economic development objectives of Pakistan, in 
areas like creating jobs, increasing incomes, improving competitiveness, boosting exports and fostering 
economic growth is the justification for a strategy of support to unleash the sector’s potential. Keeping this in 
view, SBP issued separate Prudential Regulations for SMEs in 2003, which were subsequently revised in 2013 
and 2016 in line with the changing market dynamics.  
 
Banks & DFIs had tilt towards larger-size medium enterprises as compared to small enterprises (SEs) in their 
banking business. Therefore, for improving SEs’ access to finance, SME definition prescribed in the PRs issued 
in 2003 was segregated and small enterprises and medium enterprises were separately defined in 2013, along 
with formulation of specific regulations for the small enterprises (SEs). We feel that a separate definition for 
small enterprises is helping banks & DFIs in aligning their business strategy with the SE Financing needs.  
 
Then in 2016, certain amendments were made in these regulations while responding to market changes. These 
included changes in the definition of small enterprise (SE) and medium enterprise (ME), upward revision in per 
party exposure limit for SE financing, requirement of audited accounts for SE Financing for exposure above Rs 
15 million, waiver of general reserve requirement against SEs’ non-fund based portfolio and rationalization of 
cash repayment requirement for immediate declassification of SE and ME restructured/ rescheduled loans.  
 
Recently, a holistic exercise was undertaken by SBP in collaboration with concerned stakeholders to plug in the 
gaps in the way of smooth SME financing in the country. In this regard, ‘Policy for Promotion of SME Finance’ 
was launched by the Prime Minister of Pakistan on 22nd December 2017. In this perspective, amendments have 
been introduced in following SME financing PRs to allow rapid promotion of SME financing in the country: 
 
1) 
Regulation SME R-1: SME Specific Credit Policy 
2) 
Regulation SME R-2: e-CIB Report 
3) 
Regulation SME R-9: General Measures 
4) 
Regulation SE R-7: General Reserve against Small Enterprise Finance 
5) 
Regulation SE R-10: Turn-Around-Time  
6) 
Regulation ME R-6: Turn-Around-Time (newly introduced)

It is worth mentioning that providing enabling regulatory framework is one important aspect only. Visible 
improvement in SME Financing will only occur when banks & DFIs re-position themselves strategically in the 
market by appropriately aligning their business strategies with the specific needs of the SME sector. The 
regulatory framework will bear its intended results, only if banks & DFIs take the necessary steps including the 
following:  
 
 Bring strategic change at higher level to expand share in SME portfolio. 
 Use relevant/ practical cash flow estimation techniques and other proxies to assess repayment capacity 
of SME borrowers.  
 Adopt program-based lending & down scaling strategies. 
 Make appropriate alignment in their risk management processes. 
 Allocate adequate resources for research & development. 
 Take effective measures to capture market niche by conducting market segmentation. 
 Strengthen credit appraisal and monitoring mechanism by greater use of technology and 
documentation to undertake effective review of SME Portfolio. 
 Adopt measures for greater financial awareness of SMEs specially SEs. 
 
State Bank of Pakistan monitors the situation closely, and works with banks & DFIs to make SME banking a viable 
success on sustainable basis. For this purpose, SBP is open to review any regulatory provision, if necessary, while 
ensuring at the same time that banks & DFIs observe due prudence and necessary oversight.  
 
The Prudential Regulations for small and medium enterprises (SMEs) financing cover Risk Management (R) 
aspects. The Prudential Regulations for Corporate/ Commercial Banking may be referred to for areas concerning 
Corporate Governance (G) and Operations (O) aspects as well as Anti-Money Laundering and Combating the 
Financing of Terrorism (AML/ CFT) Regulations issued by BP&RD. However, in case of international operations, 
the prudential regulations of host country shall prevail. 
 
The Prudential Regulations for small and medium enterprises (SMEs) financing do not supersede other directives 
issued by State Bank of Pakistan in respect of areas not covered here. Any violation or circumvention of these 
regulations shall render the bank/DFI officer(s) concerned liable for penalties under the Banking Companies 
Ordinance, 1962.

For loan size of upto Rs 2 million, it will be at the discretion of the banks & DFIs to obtain 
the insurance cover of the hypothecated stock/ other securities keeping in view the credit-
worthiness, past experience and financial strength of the prospective borrower. However, 
if a bank/DFI decides to obtain an insurance cover, then it will not force to the respective 
borrower for arranging the same from an insurance company of the bank’s/ DFI’s choice. 
iv. 
Banks & DFIs are encouraged to adopt program based lending. The Chief Executive Officer 
of the bank/ DFI concerned will approve conventional/ Shariah-compliant program-based 
products on recommendation of the respective committee. Such programs may carry 
objective/ quantitative parameters for eligibility of borrowers, besides standardization and 
simplification of loan documents required from the borrowers under the subject Program. 
v. 
Banks & DFIs shall adopt standardized and simplified loan application forms circulated by 
PBA. 
 
 
In case of SE Financing, following minimum points shall be covered under banks’/ DFIs’ Credit 
Policy:

Clearly devised plan of the banks & DFIs regarding their frequency of visits to be made to 
SE borrowers’ business sites keeping in view their human resource limitations and the 
amount of exposure taken upon SEs. However, banks & DFIs shall ensure that at least one 
visit must be made to SE borrowers’ sites during a year’s time. 
vii. 
In case the finance is secured against hypothecation of stock, banks & DFIs shall obtain stock 
report at least semi-annually. 
 
Regulation SME R-2: Electronic Credit Information Bureau (e-CIB) Report 
While considering any credit proposal (including renewal, enhancement and rescheduling/ 
restructuring), banks & DFIs shall obtain e-CIB Report on their prospective borrower(s) from 
Electronic Credit Information Bureau (e-CIB) of State Bank of Pakistan. Banks & DFIs shall give due 
weightage to the credit report relating to the borrower(s) and concerned group. However, they 
can take exposure on defaulters keeping in view their risk management policies and criteria, 
provided they properly record reasons and justifications in the approval form.

declaration from the SME to ensure that the accumulated clean exposure on an SME does not 
exceed the prescribed limit mentioned above.

Regulation SME R-6: Restriction on Facilities to Related Parties 
Banks & DFIs shall not take any exposure on an SME in which any of its directors, major 
shareholders holding 5% or more of the share capital of the bank/ DFI or its Chief Executive, or an 
Employee or any family member of these persons is interested, except as specified in section 24 
of the BCO, 1962. In this regard, it will, however, suffice if banks & DFIs obtain an undertaking

Regulation SE R-1: Definition of Small Enterprise 
A Small Enterprise (SE) is a business entity, which meets the following parameters:                 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Number of Employees 
Annual Sales Turnover 
*Up to 50 
Up to Rs. 150 million 
   *including contract employees. 
Further, an entity has to fulfill both the criteria of number of employees and sales turnover for   
categorization as small enterprise. However, in cases where an entity fulfils one parameter of SE 
and its second parameter falls within the range prescribed for medium enterprise (ME) or above 
the upper limit prescribed for ME, then the subject entity shall be classified as ME or commercial/ 
corporate entity as the case may be. 
 
Regulation SE R-2: Per Party Exposure Limit 
Small Enterprise can avail exposure up to Rs 25 million from a single bank/ DFI or from all banks 
& DFIs. Banks &  DFIs are allowed to deduct the liquid assets (encashment value of bank deposits, 
certificates of deposit/ investment, Pakistan Investment Bonds, Treasury Bills and National Saving 
Scheme Securities) held under their perfected lien for the purpose of calculation of per party 
exposure limit. 
 
Regulation SE R-3: Requirement of Audited Accounts 
Banks & DFIs are not required to obtain copy of audited accounts in case of lending to the small 
enterprises for exposure upto Rs 15 million. However, in such cases, banks & DFIs may ask the 
borrower to submit financial accounts in some form, signed by the borrower, to help banks & DFIs 
assess SEs’ cash flows or carry out counter verification etc. 
In case of lending to small enterprises above Rs 15 million, banks & DFIs shall obtain from the 
small enterprises a copy of financial statements duly audited by a practicing Chartered Accountant 
or a practicing Cost and Management Accountant for analysis and record. However, banks & DFIs 
may waive the requirement of obtaining audited copy of financial statements when the exposure 
net of liquid assets does not exceed the limit of Rs 15 million.   
Regulation SE R-4: Repayment Capacity of the Borrower and Cash Flow Based Lending 
Normally, small enterprises do not maintain proper financial accounts for the satisfaction of banks 
& DFIs. Their record generally contains sale/ purchase books and cash received/ paid records in a 
rudimentary form. Banks & DFIs shall use relevant/ practical cash flow estimation techniques and 
other proxies to assess repayment capacity of SE borrower. To supplement, banks & DFIs are 
encouraged to use the available sector/ cluster specific financial models that can capture cost 
structure, revenue streams and margins in the sectors. For program-based lending, banks & DFIs 
may also use, as a substitute, Income Estimation Models to assess repayment capacity of the 
borrowers.  
 
Small & Medium Enterprise Financing

Regulation SE R-5: Collateral Valuation 
For valuation of securities against loans up to Rs 5 million, banks & DFIs at their own discretion 
may either use the services of their own evaluating staff or the services of PBA approved 
evaluator. However, valuation of securities for loans above Rs 5 million shall be done only by an 
evaluator on the approved panel of PBA. 
 
Regulation SE R-6: Recovery of Outstanding Dues 
To facilitate the recovery efforts, banks & DFIs are allowed to undertake cash collection/ recovery 
at places other than their authorized places of business as stipulated in the ‘Fair Debt Collection 
Guidelines’ issued by Banking Policy and Regulations Department. However, in order to prevent 
fraud and misappropriation of collected cash, adequate security and risk management measures 
(including but not limited to adequate insurance cover all the time) must be in place and this 
process should be appropriately documented, and audited at the bank/ DFI level. The banks & 
DFIs are also encouraged to make use of mobile and wireless technologies/ devices for instant 
updating of cash collection from field into their books and accounts, and sending confirmatory 
SMS/ alert messages to borrowers.   
 
Regulation SE R-7: General Reserve against Small Enterprise Finance 
Banks & DFIs shall maintain general reserve equivalent to 1% of their unsecured SE portfolio to 
protect them from the risks associated with the economic and cyclical nature of this business. This 
reserve requirement shall, however, be maintained only for the performing fund based SE 
portfolio of banks & DFIs. In order to calculate the general reserve, liquid securities under 
perfected lien (encashment value of bank deposits, certificates of deposit/ investment, Pakistan 
Investment Bonds, Treasury Bills and National Saving Scheme Securities) held against banks’/ DFIs’ 
fund-based SE portfolio shall be netted. 
 
Regulation SE R-8: Classification and Provisioning for Loans/ Advances 
1. Banks & DFIs shall observe prudential guidelines given in this Regulation and at Annexure I 
& II of these Regulations in the matter of classification of their SE asset portfolio and 
provisioning there-against. 
2. In addition to the time-based criteria prescribed in Annexure I, subjective evaluation of 
performing and non-performing credit portfolio may be made for risk assessment purpose 
and, where considered necessary, any account including the performing account shall be 
classified, and the category of classification determined on the basis of time based criteria 
shall be further downgraded. However, classification for program-based lending shall be 
done based on objective (time-based) criteria only, though banks & DFIs at their own 
discretion may also classify such portfolio on subjective basis.  
3. In case of revolving/ running finance accounts, if the borrower pays mark-up regularly 
without showing turn-over in the principal portion of the account, and bank/ DFI is satisfied 
with this conduct and is willing to roll over the facility periodically; then such account will not 
Small & Medium Enterprise Financing 
Prudential Regulations 
 
9  
 
attract ‘subjective classification’ on the basis of lower/ nil activity in the principal account. 
However, banks & DFIs can classify, at their discretion, such accounts as per their own policy. 
4. Banks & DFIs can avail the benefit of Forced Sale Value (FSV) of collateral held against loans/ 
advances, determined in accordance with the guidelines laid down in Annexure II, before 
making any provision.  
5. Party-wise details of cases, where banks & DFIs have taken the benefit of FSV shall be 
maintained for verification by State Bank’s teams during their regular/ special inspection.  
6. Banks & DFIs shall review, at least on a quarterly basis, the collectability of their loans/ 
advances portfolio and shall properly document the evaluations so made. Shortfall in 
provisioning, if any, determined, because of quarterly assessment shall be provided for 
immediately in their books of accounts by the banks & DFIs on quarterly basis. 
7. In case of cash recovery, other than rescheduling/ restructuring, banks & DFIs may reverse 
specific provision held against classified assets only to the extent that required provision as 
determined under this Regulation is maintained. 
8. Banks &  DFIs will make suitable arrangements for ensuring that FSV used for taking benefit 
of provisioning is determined accurately as per guidelines contained in these PRs and is 
reflective of market conditions under forced sale situations. 
9. The external auditors shall, as part of their annual audits of banks & DFIs, verify that all 
requirements as stipulated above and in Annexure I & II for classification and provisioning 
have been complied with. State Bank of Pakistan shall also check the adequacy of 
provisioning during on-site inspection. 
Regulation SE R-9: Restructuring/ Rescheduling of Loans/ Advances 
1. The banks & DFIs may reschedule/ restructure problem loans as per their own policy duly 
approved by their Board of Directors. However, the rescheduling/ restructuring of non-
performing loans shall not change the status of classification of a loan/ advance etc. unless 
the following minimum conditions are met: 
i. 
At least 10% of the outstanding loan amount is recovered in cash and the terms and 
conditions of rescheduling/ restructuring are fully met for a period of at least 6 months 
(excluding grace period, if any) from the date of such rescheduling/ restructuring. 
However, the condition of 6 Months retention period, prescribed for restructured/ 
rescheduled loan account to remain in the classified category, shall not apply in case 
the borrower has repaid or adjusted in cash at least 35% of the total restructured loan 
amount (principal + mark-up), either at the time of restructuring agreement or later-
on any time before the completion of 6 Months period as above mentioned. 
ii. 
Rescheduling shall not be done simply to avoid classification.  
iii. 
While reporting to the Credit Information Bureau (e-CIB) of State Bank of Pakistan, 
such loans/ advances may be shown as ‘rescheduled/ restructured’ instead of 
‘default’.  
iv. 
Restructuring/ rescheduling of a loan account shall not lead to disqualification of the 
borrower for fresh credit facilities or enhancement in the existing limits. Such fresh 
Small & Medium Enterprise Financing 
Prudential Regulations 
 
10  
 
loans may be monitored separately, and shall be subject to classification on the 
strength of their own specific terms and conditions. 
v. 
Where a borrower subsequently defaults (either principal or mark-up) after the 
rescheduled/ restructured loan has been declassified by a bank/ DFI, the loan shall 
again be classified in the same category it was in at the time of rescheduling/ 
restructuring and the unrealized markup on such loans taken to income account shall 
also be reversed. However, banks & DFIs at their discretion may further downgrade 
the classification, taking into account the subjective criteria. 
Regulation SE R-10: Turn-Around-Time 
Banks & DFIs shall not take more than 15 working days for the credit approval process (from the 
date of receipt of complete information). In this respect, the following minimum points shall also 
be considered:   
i. 
The pre-approval requirements and post-approval requirements (security/ collateral 
documentation etc.) shall be advised preferably in one go.  
ii. 
The facility shall be disbursed only after security documentation is completed by the 
customer.

Regulation ME R-1: Definition of Medium Enterprise 
Medium Enterprise (ME) is a business entity, ideally not a public limited company which meets 
the following parameters: 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
                        
*Number of Employees  
Annual Sales Turn-Over  
51-250  (Manufacturing & Service MEs)  
51-100  (Trading MEs)  
Above Rs 150 million and up to Rs 800 million 
(All types of Medium Enterprises) 
   *including contract employees. 
Further, an entity has to fulfill both the criteria of number of employees and sales turnover for 
categorization as medium enterprise. However, when an entity’s one parameter is as per ME 
criteria and its second parameter is as per SE criteria, than subject entity would be categorized as 
ME. Similarly, when an entity’s one parameter is as per ME and its second parameter is above the 
upper limit prescribed for ME, then the subject entity shall be categorized as commercial/ 
corporate entity. 
 
Regulation ME R-2: Repayment Capacity and Cash Flow Based Lending 
1. 
Banks & DFIs shall specifically identify the sources of repayment and assess the repayment 
capacity of the borrower on the basis of assets conversion cycle and expected future cash 
flows. In order to add value, banks & DFIs are encouraged to assess conditions prevailing in 
the particular sector/ industry they are lending to and its future prospects. Banks & DFIs 
should be able to identify the key drivers of their borrowers’ businesses, the key risks 
associated with their businesses and their risk mitigants. Banks & DFIs may also use Income 
Estimation Models specially in program-based lending to assess repayment capacity of the 
borrowers.  
2. 
The rationale and parameters used to project the future cash flows shall be documented and 
annexed with the cash flow analysis undertaken by banks & DFIs. 
 
Regulation ME R-3: Per Party Exposure Limit 
Medium Enterprise can avail financing (including leased assets) upto Rs 200 million from a single 
bank/ DFI or from all banks & DFIs. It is expected that Medium Enterprises approaching this limit 
should have achieved certain sophistication as they migrate into larger firms and should be able 
to meet the requirements of Prudential Regulations for Corporate/ Commercial Banking.  
Banks & DFIs are allowed to deduct the liquid assets (encashment value of bank deposits, 
certificates of deposit/ investment, Pakistan Investment Bonds, Treasury Bills and National Saving 
Scheme Securities) held under their perfected lien for the purpose of calculation of per party 
exposure limit.

Regulation ME R-4: Requirement of Audited Accounts 
In case of lending to medium enterprises, banks & DFIs shall obtain a copy of financial statements 
duly audited by a practicing Chartered Accountant, from the medium enterprise who is a limited 
company or where the exposure of a bank/ DFI exceeds Rs 10 million, for analysis and record. 
Banks & DFIs may also accept a copy of financial statements duly audited by a practicing Cost and 
Management Accountant in case of a borrower other than a public company or a private 
company, which is a subsidiary of a public company. However, banks & DFIs may waive the 
requirement of obtaining audited copy of financial statements when the exposure net of liquid 
assets does not exceed the limit of Rs 10 million.   
 
Regulation ME R-5: Classification and Provisioning for Assets 
Loans/ Advances 
1. Banks & & DFIs shall observe the prudential guidelines given at Annexure III & IV in the matter 
of classification of their ME asset portfolio and provisioning there-against. In addition to the 
time-based criteria prescribed in Annexure III, subjective evaluation of performing and non-
performing credit portfolio may be made for risk assessment purpose and, where considered 
necessary, any account including the performing account shall be classified, and the category 
of classification determined on the basis of time based criteria shall be further downgraded. 
Such evaluation shall be carried out on the basis of credit worthiness of the borrower, its cash 
flow, operation in the account, adequacy of the security inclusive of its realizable value and 
documentation covering the advances. However, classification for program-based lending 
shall be based on objective criteria. Nevertheless, banks & DFIs may, at their own discretion, 
also classify such portfolio on subjective basis. 
2. Banks &  DFIs shall classify their loans/ advances and make provisions in accordance with the 
criteria prescribed above, and further stipulated in Annexure III & IV and also keeping in view 
the following:  
a. 
Banks &  DFIs may avail the prescribed benefit of FSV subject to compliance with the 
following conditions:  
I. 
The additional impact on profitability arising from availing the benefit of FSV against 
the pledged stocks, plant & machinery under charge, and mortgaged residential, 
commercial & industrial properties shall not be available for payment of cash or 
stock dividend.  
II. 
Heads of Credit of respective banks &  DFIs shall ensure that FSV used for taking 
benefit of provisioning is determined accurately as per guidelines contained in PRs 
and is reflective of market conditions under forced sale situations; and  
III. Party-wise details of all such cases where banks & DFIs have availed the benefit of 
FSV shall be maintained for verification by State Bank’s inspection team during 
regular/ special inspection.  
b. 
Any misuse of FSV benefit detected during regular/ special inspection of SBP shall attract 
strict punitive action under the relevant provisions of the Banking Companies Ordinance, 
Small & Medium Enterprise Financing 
Prudential Regulations 
 
14  
 
1962. Further, SBP may also withdraw the benefit of FSV from banks & DFIs found 
involved in its misuse. 
 
Rescheduling/ Restructuring 
3. The rescheduling/ restructuring of non-performing loans shall not change the status of 
classification of a loan/ advance etc. unless the terms and conditions of rescheduling/ 
restructuring are fully met for a period of at least one year (excluding grace period, if any) 
from the date of such rescheduling/ restructuring and at least 10% of the outstanding amount 
is recovered in cash. However, the condition of one year retention period, prescribed for 
restructured/ rescheduled loan account to remain in the classified category, shall not apply in 
case the borrower has repaid or adjusted in cash at least 35% of the total restructured loan 
amount (principal + mark-up), either at the time of restructuring agreement or later-on any 
time before the completion of one year period as above mentioned. Further, banks & DFIs 
may credit their income account to the extent of cash recovery made against accrued markup 
on the restructured/ rescheduled loans.  
4. Banks & DFIs shall ensure that Rescheduling is not done simply to avoid classification. While 
reporting to the Credit Information Bureau (e-CIB) of State Bank of Pakistan, such loans/ 
advances may be shown as ‘rescheduled/ restructured’ instead of ‘default’.  
Where a borrower subsequently defaults (either principal or mark-up) after the rescheduled/ 
restructured loan has been declassified by a bank/ DFI as per above guidelines, the loan shall 
again be classified in the same category it was in at the time of rescheduling/ restructuring 
and the unrealized markup on such loans taken to income account shall also be reversed. 
However, banks & DFIs may, at their discretion, further downgrade the classification, taking 
into account the subjective criteria. 
At the time of rescheduling/ restructuring, banks & DFIs shall consider and examine the 
requests for working capital strictly on merit, keeping in view the viability of the project/ 
business and appropriately securing their interest etc. 
All fresh loans granted by the banks &  DFIs to a party after rescheduling/ restructuring of its 
existing facilities may be monitored separately, and will be subject to classification under this 
Regulation on the strength of their own specific terms and conditions. 
 
Timing of Creating Provisions 
5. Banks & DFIs shall review, at least on a quarterly basis, the collectability of their loans/ 
advances portfolio and shall properly document the evaluations so made. Shortfall in 
provisioning, if any, determined, as a result of quarterly assessment shall be provided for 
immediately in their books of accounts on quarterly basis. 
 
Reversal of Provision 
6. In case of cash recovery, other than rescheduling/ restructuring, banks & DFIs may reverse 
specific provision held against classified assets only to the extent that required provision as 
determined under this Regulation is maintained. While calculating the remaining provision 
Small & Medium Enterprise Financing 
Prudential Regulations 
 
15  
 
required to be held after cash recovery and reversal of provision there-against, banks & DFIs 
shall still enjoy the benefit of netting-off the amount of liquid assets and FSV of collateral from 
the outstanding amount, as described in this regulation. Further, the provision made on the 
advice of State Bank of Pakistan except where cash recovery is made shall not be reversed 
without prior approval of State Bank of Pakistan. 
 
Verification by the Auditors 
7. The external auditors shall verify as part of their annual audits of banks & DFIs that all 
requirements as stipulated above and Annexure III & IV for classification and provisioning for 
assets have been complied with. State Bank of Pakistan shall also check the adequacy of 
provisioning during on-site inspection.  
 
Regulation ME R-6: Turn-Around-Time  
Banks & DFIs shall not take more than 25 working days for the credit approval process (from the 
date of receipt of complete information). In this respect, the following minimum points shall also 
be considered: 
i. 
The pre-approval requirements and post-approval requirements (security/ collateral 
documentation etc.) shall be advised preferably in one go.  
ii. 
The facility shall be disbursed only after the customer completes security documentation.

Uniform Criteria for Determining the Value of Pledged Stock, Plant & Machinery 
Under Charge and Mortgaged Properties 
 
1. Banks & DFIs are allowed to take the benefit of Forced Sale Value (FSV) of pledged stocks, plant 
& machinery under charge, and mortgaged residential, commercial and industrial properties held 
as collateral against Non Performing Loans (NPLs) for calculating provisioning requirement as 
tabulated below:  
 
Category of Asset  
Forced Sale Value Benefit allowed from the 
date of classification  
Mortgaged residential, commercial and 
industrial properties (Land & building only)  
 
75% for first year  
 
60% for second year  
 
45% for third year  
 
30% for fourth year, and  
 
20% for fifth year  
Plant & Machinery under charge  
 
30% for first year  
 
20% for second year, and  
 
10% for third year  
Pledged stock  
 
40% for first, second, and third year  
 
The benefit of FSV against NPLs shall not be available after the period prescribed above.  
2. While taking benefit of FSV and arriving at its value, the following minimum points shall be 
taken into account:  
a) At the time of classification, valuation shall not be more than 3 years old.  
b) Valuations shall be carried out by an independent professional evaluator who should be 
listed on the panel of evaluators maintained by the Pakistan Banks’ Association (PBA).  
c) Only liquid assets, pledged stock, plant & machinery under charge and property having 
registered or equitable mortgage shall be considered for taking benefit for provisioning, 
provided no NOC for creating further charge to another bank/ DFI/ NBFC has been issued 
by the bank/ DFI. Assets having pari-passu charge shall be considered on proportionate 
basis of the outstanding amount.  
d) Hypothecated assets and assets with second charge & floating charge shall not be 
considered for taking the benefit for provisioning purposes.  
e) The evaluator, while assigning any values to the pledged stock, plant and machinery under 
charge and mortgaged residential, commercial and industrial properties (land and 
building only), shall take into account all relevant factors affecting the salability of such 
assets including any difficulty in obtaining their possession, their location, condition and 
the prevailing economic conditions in the relevant sector, business or industry. The values 
of pledged stock, plant and machinery under charge and mortgaged property so 
determined by the evaluators have to be reasonably good estimate of the amount that 
could currently be obtained by selling such assets in a forced/ distressed sale condition. 
Small & Medium Enterprise Financing 
Prudential Regulations 
 
20  
 
The evaluators should also mention in their report the assumptions made, the 
calculations/ formulae/ basis used and the method adopted in determination of the 
values i.e. the forced sales value (FSV).  
f) In cases where the evaluators are not allowed by the borrowers to enter in their premises, 
the benefit of FSV shall not be accepted for provisioning purposes. 
g) The additional impact on profitability arising from availing the benefit of FSV against 
pledged stocks, plant and machinery under charge, and mortgaged residential, 
commercial and industrial properties (land and building only) shall not be available for 
payment of cash or stock dividend. 
3. Any misuse of FSV benefit detected during regular/ special inspection of SBP shall attract strict 
punitive action under the relevant provisions of the Banking Companies Ordinance, 1962. Further, 
SBP may also withdraw the benefit of FSV from banks & DFIs found involved in its misuse. 
4. Various categories of assets to be considered for valuation would be as under (no other assets 
shall be taken into consideration):  
a) Liquid Assets: 
Valuation of Liquid Assets shall be determined by the bank & DFI itself and verified by the external 
auditors. However, in the case of pledged shares of listed companies, values should be taken at 
market value as per active list of Stock Exchange on the balance sheet date. Moreover, valuation 
of shares pledged against loans/ advances shall be considered only if such shares are in 
dematerialized form in the Central Depository Company of Pakistan (CDC), otherwise these will 
not be admissible for deduction as liquid assets while determining required provisions. 
 
b) Mortgaged Property and Plant & Machinery under Charge: 
Valuation of residential, commercial and industrial property (land and building only) and plant & 
machinery would be accepted as determined by the evaluators in accordance with the criteria 
given above. 
 
c) Pledged Stocks: 
In case of pledged stocks of perishable and non-perishable goods, forced sale value should be 
provided by evaluators, and such valuation should not be more than six months old, at each 
balance sheet date. The goods should be perfectly pledged, the operation of the godown (s) or 
warehouse(s) should be in the control of banks & DFIs and relevant documents should be 
available. In case of perishable goods, the evaluator should also give the approximate date of 
complete erosion of value of pledged stock.

Uniform Criteria for Determining the Value of Pledged Stock, Plant & Machinery  
under Charge and Mortgaged Properties  
 
1. Only liquid assets, pledged stock, plant & machinery under charge and residential, commercial 
and industrial property having registered or equitable mortgage shall be considered for taking 
benefit for provisioning, provided no NOC for creating further charge to another bank/ DFI/ NBFC 
has been issued by the bank/ DFI. The aforesaid assets having pari-passu charge shall be 
considered on proportionate basis of outstanding amount. 
 
2. Hypothecated assets and assets with second charge & floating charge shall not be considered 
for taking the benefit for provisioning. 
 
3. Banks & DFIs are allowed to take the benefit of Forced Sale Value (FSV) of pledged stocks, plant 
& machinery under charge, and mortgaged residential, commercial and industrial properties held 
as collateral against Non Performing Loans (NPLs) for calculating provisioning requirement as 
tabulated below:

Pledged stock  
 
40% for first, second, and third year  
 
The benefit of FSV against NPLs shall not be available after the period prescribed above.  
 
4. Valuations shall be carried out by an independent professional evaluator who should be listed 
on the panel of evaluators maintained by the Pakistan Banks’ Association (PBA). For selection and 
listing of the evaluators, PBA lays down the minimum eligibility criteria with the prior approval of 
the State Bank of Pakistan. The evaluator, while assigning any values to the pledged stock, plant 
& machinery under charge and residential, commercial and industrial mortgaged property, shall 
take into account all relevant factors affecting the salability of such assets including any difficulty 
in obtaining their possession, their location, condition and the prevailing economic conditions in 
the relevant sector, business or industry. The values of pledged stock, plant & machinery under 
charge and residential, commercial and industrial mortgaged property so determined by the 
evaluators must have to be a reasonably good estimate of the amount that could currently be 
obtained by selling such assets in a forced/ distressed sale condition. The evaluators should also

mention in their report the assumptions made, the calculations/ formulae/basis used and the 
method adopted in determination of the values i.e. the forced sale value (FSV). 
 
5. The valuation process shall include conducting a ‘Full-Scope Valuation’ of the assets in the first 
year and then followed by ‘Desktop Evaluations’ in the second and third year. Full-scope valuation 
shall be valid for three years from the date of last Full-scope valuation. 
  
6. The following may be noted in respect of the Desktop and Full-Scope Valuations: 
 
 
Desktop Evaluation is defined as “an Interim Brief Review of Full-Scope Evaluation, so that 
any significant change in the factors, on which the full-scope valuation was based, is 
accounted for and brought to the notice of the lending bank/ DFI.” 
 
 
In case the loans exceed Rs 100 million, the Desktop Valuation shall be done by the same 
evaluator, who had conducted the Full-Scope Valuation (the evaluator should be on the 
approved panel of the PBA) whereas for loans below this threshold, the Desktop Valuation 
may be done by banks & DFIs themselves or by the approved evaluators. For conducting 
Desktop Evaluation, the evaluators shall pay a short visit to the borrower’s site. Banks’/ 
DFIs’ responsibility in this respect will be to ensure that the evaluator is contacted for 
conducting Desktop Valuation, and is provided all necessary information which is 
materially important for the interim review. 
 
 
Desktop Valuation shall be used for determining any additional provisioning requirement 
only and will not be applied for reducing the provisioning requirement, assessed on the 
basis of Full-Scope Valuation. 
 
 
In cases where the evaluators are not allowed by the borrowers to enter in their premises, 
the Full-Scope Valuation, conducted as such, will not be accepted for provisioning benefit. 
 
7. State Bank of Pakistan may check the valuations of the assets under mortgage/ charge, through 
an independent evaluator, on random basis, to verify the reasonableness of the valuations. The 
unjustified differences in the valuations of banks & DFIs and State Bank of Pakistan shall render 
the concerned bank/ DFI and evaluator to penal actions including, interalia, withdrawal of FSV 
benefit. 
 
8. Various categories of assets to be considered for valuation would be as under (no other assets 
shall be taken into consideration):  
 
a) Liquid Assets: 
Valuation of Liquid Assets shall be determined by a bank/ DFI itself and verified by the external 
auditors. However, in the case of pledged shares of listed companies, values should be taken at 
market value as per active list of Stock Exchange(s) on the balance sheet date. Moreover, 
valuation of shares pledged against loans/ advances shall be considered only if such shares are in

b) Mortgaged Property and Plant & Machinery under Charge: 
Valuation of residential, commercial and industrial mortgaged property (land and building only) 
and plant & machinery would be accepted as determined by the evaluators in accordance with 
the criteria given above. 
 
c) Pledged Stocks: 
In case of pledged stocks of perishable and non-perishable goods, forced sale value should be 
provided by evaluators, and such valuation should not be more than six months old, at each 
balance sheet date. The goods should be perfectly pledged, the operation of the godown(s) or
