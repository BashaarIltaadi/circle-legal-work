(a) 
the examination of the circumstances surrounding the sale of the

relationship did not influence the price; or  
(b) 
the importer demonstrates that such value closely approximates 
to one of the following Test Values occurring at or about the 
same time:  
(i) 
the transaction value in sales to unrelated buyers of 
identical or similar goods for export to Pakistan.  
 
 
(ii)

determined under the provisions of sub-section (7) 
(deductive value);

determined  under the provisions of sub-section (8) 
(computed value).  
 
 
Provided that in applying the foregoing tests due account shall be taken of 
demonstrated differences in commercial levels, quantity levels, the elements 
enumerated in sub-section (2) and costs incurred by the seller in sales in which the 
seller and the buyer are not related that are not incurred by the seller in sales in which 
the seller and the buyer are related; 
 
 
32[(4) Where, in relation to the goods being valued, the appropriate officer is of 
the opinion that the importer has not, for the purposes of clause (a) of sub-section (3), 
demonstrated that the relationship did not influence the price or, for the purposes of 
clause (b) of sub-section (3), that the declared price at which the goods are imported 
does not closely approximate to one of the test values mentioned therein, the 
appropriate officer shall inform the importer of his reservations in writing and give the 
importer an opportunity to justify the price difference. If the importer fails to justify the 
price difference, the customs value cannot be determined under the provisions of sub-
section (1).]    
 
(5) 
TRANSACTION VALUE OF IDENTICAL GOODS.-  If the customs 
value of the imported goods cannot be  determined under the provisions of sub-section

(a) 
In applying the 33[provisions] of this sub-section, the transaction 
value of 34[the] identical goods in a sale at the same commercial 
level and substantially the same quantity as the goods being 
valued shall be used to determine the customs value of imported 
goods.  
(b) 
Where no sale referred to in clause (a) is found, the transaction 
value of identical goods sold at a different commercial level 
 THE CUSTOMS ACT,1969 
 
31 
 
and/or in different quantities, adjusted to take account of 
differences attributable to commercial level and/or to quantity 
shall be used, provided that such adjustments can be made on the 
basis of demonstrated evidence which clearly establishes the 
reasonableness and accuracy of the adjustment, whether the 
adjustment leads to an increase or decrease in the value. 
(c) 
Where the costs and charges referred to in clause (a) of sub-
section (2) are included in the transaction value of identical 
goods, an adjustment shall be made to take account of significant 
differences in such costs and charges between the goods being 
valued and the identical goods in question arising from 
differences in distances and modes of transport.   
35,106[(d)  
Omitted]

transaction value of similar goods sold for export to Pakistan and exported at or about 
the same time as the goods being valued, and the provisions of clauses (a), (b) 107[and] 
(c)108[omitted] of sub-section (5) shall, mutatis mutandis, also apply in respect of

(c)

(10)

the purposes of levying duties of customs and other taxes on 
imported goods; 
 
(b)

conforming to the definition from being regarded as identical;   
(c) 
“similar goods” means goods which although not alike in all 
respects, have like characteristics and like component materials 
which enable them to perform the same functions and to be 
commercially interchangeable. The quality of the goods, their

to be considered in determining whether goods are similar; 
(d) 
the terms “identical goods” and “similar goods” do not include as 
the case may be, goods which incorporate or reflect engineering 
development, art work, design work, and plans and sketches for 
 THE CUSTOMS ACT,1969 
 
34 
 
which no adjustment has been made under sub-section 2(c) (iv) 
because such elements were undertaken in Pakistan; 
(e) 
goods shall not be regarded as “identical goods” or “similar 
goods” unless they were produced in the same country as the 
goods being valued; 
(f) 
goods produced by a different person shall be taken into account 
only when there are no identical goods or similar goods, as the 
case may be, produced by the same person as the goods being 
valued; and  
(g) 
“goods of the same class or kind” means goods which fall within 
a group or range of goods produced by a particular industry or 
industry sector, and includes identical or similar goods.

and which will be included in the customs value; 
 
(c) 
that where goods are manufactured in accordance with any 
patented invention or are goods to which any protected design 
has been applied, the customs value shall be determined taking 
into consideration the value of the right to use design in respect 
of the goods;  
 
 
 
 
(d) 
that where goods are exported for sale, other disposal or use, 
whether or not after further manufacture, under a Pakistan trade 
mark, the customs value shall be determined taking into

trade mark in respect of the goods.

that the customs value is not influenced by any commercial, 
financial or other relationship, whether by contract or otherwise 
between the seller or any person associated in business with him 
and the buyer or an person associated in business with him other 
than the relationship created by the sale itself. 
 
(c) 
that no part of the proceeds of any subsequent resale, other 
disposal or use of the goods will accrue, either directly or  
indirectly, to the seller or any person associated in business with 
him.  
 
(d) 
that two persons shall be deemed to be associated in business 
with one another if, whether directly or indirectly, either of  them

waters, or if he has alighted from, or is about to get into or is in any other 
conveyance arriving in or proceeding from Pakistan, or if he is entering or about to

unnecessary delay before an officer of customs not below the rank of an 
2/2A[Assistant Collector] of Customs.         
 
(2)   
The aforesaid officer, if he has reasonable grounds for believing that 
such person has any such goods secreted inside his body and that it is necessary to 
have the body of such person screened or X-Rayed, may make an order to that effect 
, or else discharge such person forthwith, except where he is held on any other 
grounds.     
 
(3)  
Where the aforesaid officer orders such person to be screened or X-
Rayed, the appropriate officer shall, as soon as practicable, take him to a radiologist 
possessing such qualifications as may be recognized by the 1[Federal Government] 
THE CUSTOMS ACT,1969 
  
174 
 
for that purpose and such person shall allow the radiologist to screen or X-Ray his 
body.

forward his report thereon, together with any X-Ray picture taken by him to  the 
aforesaid officer without unnecessary delay.         
 
(5)  
Where on the basis of a report from a radiologist or otherwise, the 
aforesaid officer is satisfied that any person has any goods liable to confiscation 
secreted inside his body, he may direct that suitable action for bringing such goods 
out of his body be taken on the advice and under the supervision of a registered 
medical practitioner and such person shall be bound to comply with such direction:        
 
Provided that in the case of a female no such action shall be taken except on 
the advice and under the supervision of a female registered medical practitioner.    
 
(6)  
Where any person is brought before an officer of customs not below 
the rank of an Assistant Collector 2A[**] of Customs as aforesaid, he may direct that 
pending completion of all action under this section such person be detained.         
 
(7) 
No person shall be subjected to screening or X-Ray if he confesses 
that goods liable to confiscation are secreted inside his body and of his own consent 
agrees to suitable steps being taken to bring out such goods.  
.
